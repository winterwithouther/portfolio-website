            <p id="about-me-paragraph">
                I'm a recent high school graduate with a love for Software Engineering. I have been given the 
                opportunity to undergo Flatiron's Software Engineering Bootcamp where I gained skills in Full-Stack Development.
                My skillset and youth have driven me to become an asset. I was first introduced to Programming in Highschool through a game engine,
                the idea of creation and building enticed me and drove me to become a Software Engineer. Ever since then, I thrive for continous learning
                and crafting intricate systems.
